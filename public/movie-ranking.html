<h3>Chichore</h3>
<p>
     This movie holds a special place in my heart because it shows how a students suffer in Indian Education system because of a very cut throat competiton. 
    It show cases the pressure and anxiety faced by many students before the result of IIT-JEE the toughest engineering exams in India with an acceptance rate of 1 to 1.5 perectange. 
Nearly every year 1 to 1.5 million students appear for examination to get into IIT's which can be said as equivalent of MIT. 
The fun fact is these students keep IVY league universities as their back up if they are not able to get into IIT and there are many examples of it 
that students failed to get into IIT but was accepted by IVY league universities.
I myself have given the exam and I cleared it by securing 45K rank out of over a million student. Just the fact that I have gone through 
the phase it is very close to my heart and I have read many articles about student commiting suicide because of not getting into IIT which is also addressed in the movie.</p>
